Project Initialized.
Actions Taken:
- Created backend/ and frontend/ directories.
- Created docker-compose.yml with definitions for db, backend, and frontend services.
- Created .env file with initial placeholders for database credentials.
- Created backend directory structure: app/, app/services/, tests/.
- Created placeholder files for the backend:
  - app/api.py
  - app/models.py
  - app/services/quote_calculator.py
  - app/services/data_service.py
  - app/database.py
  - app/config.py
  - seed.py
  - seed.json
  - main.py
  - requirements.txt (with initial dependencies)
  - Dockerfile (basic Python setup)
- Created frontend directory structure using Next.js app router conventions.
- Created placeholder files for the frontend:
  - app/quotes/page.tsx
  - app/quotes/[quoteId]/page.tsx
  - app/quotes/[quoteId]/components/ProductSelector.tsx
  - app/quotes/[quoteId]/components/VariationSelector.tsx

  - app/layout.tsx
  - app/globals.css
  - components/Button.tsx
  - components/Modal.tsx
  - services/apiClient.ts
  - contexts/QuoteContext.tsx
  - types/index.ts
  - package.json (with Next.js, React, TypeScript dependencies)
  - tsconfig.json (basic Next.js setup)
  - next.config.js
  - Dockerfile (basic Node.js setup for Next.js)
- Implemented SQLModel ORM models in backend/app/models.py based on the schema in plan.txt.
  - Defined all tables with their respective columns, types, and constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints).
  - Established relationships between models (e.g., Product and Material, Quote and QuoteProductEntry).
  - Used explicit table names (e.g., `__tablename__ = "unit_type"`) to match the plan.
  - Created Pydantic models (`BillOfMaterialEntry`, `AppliedRateInfoEntry`) for structuring data stored in JSONB fields (`bill_of_materials_json`, `applied_rates_info_json`).
  - Handled `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps with defaults and server-side defaults/onupdate triggers where appropriate (though the trigger from the plan is DB-level and not directly in SQLModel definitions, SQLModel handles `onupdate` for `updated_at`).
- Implemented application configuration in `backend/app/config.py` using `pydantic-settings` to load `DATABASE_URL` from the `.env` file.
- Added `pydantic-settings` to `backend/requirements.txt`.
- Implemented database engine setup and session management in `backend/app/database.py`.
  - Created a SQLAlchemy engine using the `DATABASE_URL` from `config.py`.
  - Defined a `get_session` dependency for FastAPI routes to obtain a database session.
  - Created a `create_db_and_tables` function to initialize the database schema based on SQLModel models. This function will need to be called at application startup.
- Implemented the main FastAPI application in `backend/main.py`:
  - Added a lifespan event handler to call `create_db_and_tables()` on application startup.
  - Included a basic `/health` check endpoint.
- Implemented initial CRUD API endpoints in `backend/app/api.py` for:
  - `UnitType`: POST (create), GET (list, by ID)
  - `Material`: POST (create), GET (list, by ID) - includes validation for `UnitType` existence.
  - `Product`: POST (create), GET (list, by ID) - includes validation for `UnitType` existence.
  - `QuoteConfig`: POST (create), GET (list, by ID) - includes check for existing name.
- Registered the `api_router` from `app.api` into the main FastAPI app in `main.py` with a prefix `/api/v1`.
- Defined the structure and initial data for `backend/seed.json`. This includes:
  - `unit_types`: Common units of measure.
  - `materials`: Sample construction materials with costs and units.
  - `products`: A complex sample product ("6ft Postmaster Horizontal JPC Stained Fence") including:
    - Base materials (`product_material`).
    - Variation groups (`variation_group`) like "Style" and "Add Cap Rail".
    - Variation options (`variation_option`) for each group, some with additional costs, labor, and materials (`variation_option_material`).
  - `quote_configs`: Default configurations for residential and commercial quotes.
- Implemented the database seeding script `backend/seed.py`:
  - Reads data from `seed.json`.
  - Defines functions to seed `UnitType`, `Material`, `Product` (including its nested `ProductMaterial`, `VariationGroup`, `VariationOption`, and `VariationOptionMaterial`), and `QuoteConfig`.
  - Helper functions `get_unit_type_id_by_name` and `get_material_id_by_name` are used to resolve foreign key relationships during seeding by looking up previously seeded records.
  - Ensures `create_db_and_tables()` is called before attempting to seed data.
  - Checks for existing data by name to avoid duplicates if the script is run multiple times.
- Implement the `QuoteCalculator` service in `backend/app/services/quote_calculator.py`.
- Write e2e tests for all implemented API endpoints, including the quote calculation process.


Next Steps:
- run e2e tests, check logs, iterate until evything is good
