Hello copilot agent your job is to test the frontend app to see the main process of fence quoting works 
the system allows you to cerate a fence project, select a fence product its variations, a gate, additional products, and calulate it and finalise the quote.
in order to accsess frontend visit localhost:3000 using playright mcp u have acsess to.
if u see errors in console, missing data, stuff that prevents you from completeing the tests, write them to issus.txt 
be aware that the data provided in ui is coming from the seeding we do in backend/data/seed_data.py 
when ever you face an issue that can fixed by adding / modefing seed data, suggest it.
if facing other issue try to investigate it in frontend and suggest solutions.
alwase befor running the tests you should run: 
docker-compose down -v
then
docker-compose up -d --build

when having issues you can check the logs of frontend and backend using: 
docker-compose logs frontend
docker-compose logs backend
if you want to chek the db u can use psql and creds from .env
